// from Venice, Events Recorder -> Events Proxy -> {Events Dispatcher -> Events Exporters}
//
// Event dispatcher and exporters are library modules that are shared between
// venice and NAPLES.
//
// Recorder calls are returned from the proxy. Further processing at the
// dispatcher and the exporters are asynchronous.

// Recorder records events on behalf of the events sources.
// This will carry the event source and list of supported event types.
// Events Recorder -> Events Proxy
type Recorder interface {
	// Event creates the event object which will be sent to the proxy server for
	// further processing in the pipeline.
	//
	// if  objRef != nil, the event will be created in the same tenant/namespace
	// as the reference object.
	// Otherwise, it will be created under the default tenant `globals.DefaultTenant` and `globals.DefaultNamespace`.
	//
	// eventType should be one of the valid event type
	// severity should be one of INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL
	// message is a free form text explaining the reason of the event

// Dispatcher processes all the incoming events for any duplication to avoid
// overwhelming the system with events.
// 1. Dispatcher performs de-duplication and batching. De-dup interval spans for a longer period than batch/send interval.
// 2. Dispatcher batches the de-duped events and distributes it to all the registered exporters.
// 3. Dispatcher maintains a de-dup cache for each event source separately.

	// action to be performed by the proxy when an event is received from the recorder.
