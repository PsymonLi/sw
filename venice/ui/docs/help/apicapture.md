# API Capture
The API Capture section has various REST API scripts that are available within PSM. The APIs are classified into the following categories:

     auth
     cluster
     events
     monitoring
     objstore
     search
     security
     telemetry
     workload
     
The APIs can be downloaded to your workstation and it can viewed by clicking on the blue ">" button next to the APIs.

PSM admins who are familiar with POSTMAN or CURL can use these APIs to do all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations.
All the REST operations including PUT, GET, POST, and DELETE are supported.

The URL field lets you download the API sample file.

The Live API is ordered with the API payload and response from the most recent actions and/or queries sent between the UI and PSM API server.

The gear icon allows exporting the API capture scripts into a single export file.
