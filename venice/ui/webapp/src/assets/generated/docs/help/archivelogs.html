<h2 id="archivelogs">Archive Logs</h2>
<p>Archive Logs displays all the archive log requests the PSM admin has created. The Archive logs are generated by admin action from "Audit Events" and "Alerts and Events" sub-section in "Monitoring" section. Please refer to the help of both "Audit Events" and "Alerts and Events" sub-section for more information on how to generate Archive Logs.</p>
<p>The Archive log records are selectable individually or in a group, when selected the delete operation is shown (a trash icon is shown) to let PSM admin delete the logs. Deleting old logs frees up space in PSM. Each Archive Log record has six fields and is described below -</p>
