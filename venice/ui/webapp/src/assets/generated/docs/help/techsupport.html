<h1 id="technicalsupport">Technical Support</h1>
<p>The Tech Support request gathers all relevant data from the Venice cluster nodes and NAPLES adapters into a zip file, which then can be sent to the support engineer for further troubleshooting analysis.  </p>
<p>This is a two step process, where first you create a tech support request, which will create this zip file.  The second step is to download this file onto your local server, so that it can be sent to Pensando's support engineer.</p>
<h2 id="addtechsupportrequest">Add Tech-Support Request</h2>

The creation of the tech-support files will take a little time.  Wait for the completion is successful.</p>
