<h1 id="apps">Apps</h1>
<p>Creating Apps allows to define specific protocol and ports that makes up the particular application.  Support for application-level gateway (ALG) is provided with the following predefined ALGs</p>
<ul>
<li>icmp (ping)</li>
<li>dns (domain name system)</li>
<li>ftp (file transfer protocol)</li>
<li>sunrpc (Sun Remote Procedure Call)</li>
<li>msrpc (Microsoft Remote Procedure Call)</li>
</ul>
<p>Building "apps" can be based upon these two (2) options and security rules can be applied towards this app.  The "App" is based upon the following attributes.</p>
