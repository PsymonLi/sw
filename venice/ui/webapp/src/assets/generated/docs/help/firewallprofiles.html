<h2 id="firewallprofiles">Firewall Profiles</h2>
<p>The distributed firewall uses user-imposed session limits and timeouts, to guard against brute-force TCP/UDP/ICMP flooding attacks or DDOS attacks. When the open/active session limit is exceeded, a syslog alert is generated, and any subsequent session establishment requests are dropped in the data-plane thus implicitly protecting the workload and host from flooding attacks. </p>
<p>The Firewall profile comprise of three sections -</p>
