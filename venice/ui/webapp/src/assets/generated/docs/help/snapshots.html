<p>To restore a snapshot configuration file, there are 2 options.  Within the UI, a list of snapshot files are shown under "Configurations".  To restore a particular snapshot, on the right side of that file is an restore icon.  Click on that "restore" icon and a pop-up will request you to confirm if you want to restore this snapshot.</p>
<p>In case a snapshot file is not shown on the list, the other option is to upload the snapshot file from your local repository to the PSM controller.  To do this, expand "Upload Snapshot File".  You can then click on "Choose" to select the snapshot file.  Once it is selected, you can click on "Upload" to upload the configuration.
