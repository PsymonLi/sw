<p>An authentication policy provides authentication to verify the identity of an entity (person or device) accessing Venice devices. The authentication is based on the user ID and password combination provided by the entity trying to gain access. Authentication can be performed locally, using the local database, or remotely, using one or more LDAP or RADIUS servers.</p>
