<h1 id="securitygroups">Security Groups</h1>
<p>Creating a security group allows the grouping of workloads based upon an ip prefix or based upon labels.  This provides efficiency when it comes to building security rules based upon these security groups versus individual workloads.  To create this security group, this object has the following attributes.</p>
