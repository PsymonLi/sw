<p>Within the System Upgrade view, this allows the platform to be upgraded to a new software release.  The process is broken into 2 separate tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rollout Images: This uploads the new firmware revision onto the Venice controllers</li>
<li>Create Rollout: Create the upgrade "rollout" process to update the Venice controllers and NAPLES adapters</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rolloutimages">Rollout Images</h2>
<h3 id="uploadimagefile">Upload Image File</h3>
<ul>
<li>Choose Venice image file (*.tar) </li>
<li>Select "Upload" to start the process</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: This will take a few minutes for the upload to complete</p>
<p>Once uploaded, this section will list the new available software version for upgrading under the "Images Repository"</p>
<h2 id="createrollout">Create Rollout</h2>
<p>This section defines how the software upgrade rollout will proceed. </p>
