### How to add  new cli command

#### 1. Add an entry in cli registry
CLI registry can be found in `venice/cli/api/types.go`. Modify following structure to add/modify
an entry for your proto definition objects.
```
    var Objs = map[string]ObjectInfo{
	"node": {Name: "node", Package: "clusterClient", GrpcService: "cluster", URL: "/configs/cluster/v1/nodes",
		Perms:   []string{"post", "put", "get", "list", "delete"},
		Structs: []string{"NodeCondition", "PortCondition", "ConditionStatus"}},
```

### 2. Any new pkgs in the pkg list
pkg list can be found in `venice/cli/api/pkgs.txt` directory. Add any new package there

### 3. Precompile your changes
CLI generation is not run automatically (or as a dependency change), rather must be manually triggered
using the following top level make target.
```
make pregen
```

### 4. Add yml examples for an object
Create an example configuration (with description) file in `venice/cli/examples/<objKind.>yml`, where
objKind is the new kind of object for which you are adding a new CLI command

### 5. Add unit test cases for newly added commands
First test the cli by firing up a cluster, or by running a mock server by `testserver&`. Once you know
the syntax/commands and know the familiarity, proceed to adding unit test cases in
`venice/cli/cli_test.go`. Without this, coverage test cases will fail,
and you will not be able to verify if anyone else is breaking your newly added CLI.

### 6. Run unit tests, integration tests and sanity runs as usual
