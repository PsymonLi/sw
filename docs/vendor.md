### Vendoring considerations
We want vendoring tools to do the following.
- Easy way to add newer dependencies.
- Have semver based, declarative approach to listing dependencies.
- Easy upgrade paths to ensure security patches are applied.
- Single source of truth and one place to list all the 3rd party code.
- Use widely supported, stable package management tools.

### Case for dep
[dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) meets all of the above requirements reasonably
well.

### To commit or not commit the vendor folder
dep can successfully build and pass all venice and agent tests. `dep ensure`
pulls in the entire vendored repo, then solves import dependency graph and prunes
unused packages, go tests and non-go files in vendor.

### Committing entire vendor folder
`Pros:`
- Truly 100% reproducible builds. Guards against upstream master force pushes.
- go install can be directly called without any workflow/makefile changes.

`Cons:`
- Large repo. Currently 327M. It will only get bigger.
- PR Fatigue. This will result in extra long PRs

### .gitignoring vendor
`Pros:`
- Repo will have only pensando code. Faster clone, performance.
- Slight nudge towards guarding against, directly updating vendor code and forgetting to update the manifests.

`Cons:`
- Vulnerable towards breaking upstream master changes.

### Committing only Pruned Vendor
`Pros:`
- Most balanced approach of the above two.

`Cons:`
- PR diffs can still be huge for large vendor changes. However github [automatically collapses vendor diffs](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/v5.2.0/lib/linguist/generated.rb#L328)

### Sample Workflows
#### How do I install dep
Please run `make ws-tools` to get the correct version of `dep`
We are currently on `v0.4.1` of `dep`
Avoid trusting os native package managers(brew, apt) and `go get`
as this *won't* guarantee the correct version of dep binary.
Also make sure that `which dep` always points to the one in `$GOPATH/bin`

#### Adding newer dependencies
- `dep ensure -add github.com/foo/bar`
- import github.com/foo/bar in your code.
- Commit `Gopkg.lock`, vendored code and `Gopkg.toml`

#### Updating existing dependencies
- Update the semver in `Gopkg.toml`
- Run `dep ensure`
- Commit `Gopkg.lock`, vendored code and `Gopkg.toml`

#### Removing dependencies
- Remove the imports from source.
- Run `dep ensure`
- Commit `Gopkg.lock`, vendored code and `Gopkg.toml`

#### Working with pensando forks.
- Submit a PR for the upstream fork and get it merged.
- Run `dep ensure -update github.com/pensando/foo`
- Commit `Gopkg.lock`, vendored code and `Gopkg.toml`

#### Semantic versioning cheatsheet
It is recommended to use semantic versioning for the imported packages.
Also `dep` by default uses `^` operator if no other operators are specified.
If `github.com/foo` is defined as follows
```
[[constraint]]
  name = "github.com/foo"
  version = "1.6"
```

`^` will interpret the git version as the min-boundary ranges like below.
- `1.6`   translates to the highest compatible commit available between `>=1.6.0 to < 2.0.0`
- `0.6.2` translates to the highest compatible commit available between `>=0.6.2 to < 0.7.0`
- `0.0.4` translates to the highest compatible commit available between `>=0.0.4 to < 0.1.0`

`dep` [uses an external semver library](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver)
It has support for [fancier operators and regexes](https://github.com/golang/dep#semantic-versioning)

However if our code is still compatible with `v2.0.0` and higher, just doing a dep ensure will *not*
update `github.com/foo`, We will need a corresponding `Gopkg.toml` change to the constraint as follows

```
[[constraint]]
  name = "github.com/foo"
  version = "2.0"
```

### Things to consider while adding newer packages
- Preferably use a released version of the dependency which complies with semantic versioning
- Avoid using different versions of the same repo. For eg. If you need a go package, github.com/foo/a
and github.com/foo/b, consider using a single released version of github.com/foo.
- Avoid using github.com/Sirpusen/logrus, the uppercase version as it is [deprecated](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)
- Please ensure that any changes in the checked in vendor code has a corresponding, matching entry in `Gopkg.toml` and `Gopkg.lock`

### A note on nested Vendoring
`dep` doesn't do nested vendoring. It is one of its [fundamental design goals](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/985#issuecomment-321353370)
`dep` will ensure that the nested vendoring is stripped out and flattened.
The transitive dependencies will be captured in `Gopkg.lock`

## What to do when dep's vendor flattening causes issues.
Having said that there is a small possibility that nested vendoring can cause incompatible changes
if the upstream repo is not actively maintained. Here are some mitigation we can do
to shield ourselves from this. If `github.com/foo/bar` needs `1.0` of `github.com/foo/a` and `github.com/foo/baz` `1.2` of needs `github.com/foo/a`, dep usually does a good job of figuring compatible commits. When it fails to do this here are some things
we can do to sheild ourselves.

- Find a compatible commit between 1.0 and 1.2 which satisfies github.com/foo/bar and github.com/foo/baz
- If that fails, Use an override version for the offending package. This basically tells dep to freeze on that version and then try to get compatible versions for other packages.
- If all else fails maintain a private fork by cherry picking required changes from the thid party code. (Usually we will never have to do this. The pains of doing this can far outweigh its benefits)

## Last resort to get `dep ensure` to work a.k.a sledgehammer
If you're having issues with dep solver, you can nuke `dep`'s cache.
`dep` first git clones the master into `$GOPATH/pkg/dep/sources/` and iteratively does `git reset` to find the correct versions.
If `dep` finds a package correctly resolved previously, it may fail to solve the dependency graph correctly.
Doing a `rm -rf $GOPATH/pkg/dep/sources` will clean all dep state.

PS: Considering the whole community is going towards `dep` and its flattened vendors, it is a fair assumption to expect that the
packages will keep in sync. Having a [nested vendored tree can cause a lot of suffering](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/AnMr9NL6dtc/UnyUUKcMCAAJ)
A combination of picking released versions of vendored code, and overriding dependencies is usually the ideal approach.
