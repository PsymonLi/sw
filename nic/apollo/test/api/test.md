# API gtests

Each API is tested independently and combinations of different kinds of API
are tested under DOL/IOTA. All the workflows described below deal with one
kind of API at a time.

* Legend:
    * Workflow : represents a testcase
    * Workflow B<1..> : Basic work flows, tests deal with one object at at time
    * Workflow <1...> : Postive test cases
    * Workflow N<1..> : Negative test cases
    * "[ ]" represents a batch containing api objects
    * Create/Delete/Read/Update : CRUD operations on the API
    * One : one object
    * Set : group of objects (Ex: Set1, Set2, Set3 are mutually exclusive sets
        of objects)
    * SetMax : max set of objects supported for a given API

Read operation is always called after every batch to sanitize the current state
of the system
