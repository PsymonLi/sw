#
# This .lst file runs the CAM scripts required to set up an EVPN
# between two PE routers.
#
# The hostnames of the two PE devices are set in evpn.ali
#
# Some configuration (i.e. interface indexes, IP addresses)
# can be changed in evpn.cfg
#

#
# Include user specific configuration
#

include evpn.cfg

#
# Activate the components in the following order:
#
# System Manager
# Stubs
# DC-RTM
# DC-BGP
# DC-LMGR
# DC-EVPN
#

evpn_si.cam evpn.ali

evpn_stub.cam evpn.ali

evpn_rtm.cam evpn.ali

evpn_bgp.cam evpn.ali
evpn_bgp2.cam evpn.ali
evpn_bgp3.cam evpn.ali
evpn_bgp4.cam evpn.ali

#
# evpn_bgp3.cam activates a active BGP peer
#
# In order to ensure that the passive peer is operational before the
# active peer starts requesting connections, sleep for 2 seconds between
# the two CAM scripts.

evpn_evpn.cam evpn.ali

#
# Wait for components and the LDP session to activate
# before verification
#

! sleep 30000

#
# Verify components are in the correct state
