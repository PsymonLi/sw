##Haps Init

Once you have untared tar file, use following command to load all the required processes

/nic/tools/sysinit.sh smart-host-pinned

##HAPS Configuration

Heimdall is packaged as part of haps debug image and executable is present in /nic/bin/heimdall

To push a golden networking configuration to agent

/nic/bin/heimdall  run --device-file /platform/etc/nicmgrd/eth-smart.json --config-file /nic/conf/golden_cfg.yml

You should see, nampespaces, networks, endpoints and other networking configuration being pushed to agent.

##Traffic Setup on Host
1. Once HAPS is loaded with configuration and NIC manager is started, need to restart host.
2. Load Ionic driver on host : insmod ionic/ionic.ko.
3. Bring interface(interfaces) discovered by the driver.
4. Heimdall(Testdriver) will be built for linux and host can be setup for traffic testing
  Following command will do setup for EPs.
  ./heimdall traffic --device-file eth-smart.json   --config-file configs/golden/golden_cfg.yml --ep-setup
  This command will do the following
  a. Create namespaces for each Endpoint that was pushed to agent in haps system
  b. Assign IP address for the each endpoint
  c. Maps endpoint to right interface/lif on the host
  d. Assigns right useg vlan for each endpoint.

  eth-smart.json  specifies host interfaces to lif mapping
  Press Ctrl-C to clean up the after testing. This will clean up all namespaces and interfaces


  ##Traffic Setup on Network
    Heimdall(Testdriver) will be built for linux and host can be setup for traffic testing

    Following command will do setup for EPs on remote machines which is connected to haps uplink iterfaces
    ./heimdall traffic --uplink-map uplink-map.json   --config-file configs/golden/golden_cfg.yml --ep-setup
    This command will do the following
    a. Create namespaces for each Remote Endpoint that was pushed to agent in haps system
    b. Assign IP address for the each endpoint
    c. Assigns right network vlan for each endpoint.
    d. If there are more than one EP which maps to same interface and network vlan, namespace creation will be skipped

    uplink-map.json specifies mapping for Remote server interfaces connection to HAPS interfaces.

  Press Ctrl-C to clean up the after testing. This will clean up all namespaces and interfaces
