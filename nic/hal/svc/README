This directory will provide the first layer of implementation of HAL APIs

Every HAL APIs will perform the following steps, possibly in different order:

  1. deserialize the incoming API message content
  2. extract the key fields from the message
  3. do lookups in the internal data structures
  4. create/delete/modify the internal data structures
  5. allocate/deallocate indices for P4 tables, if any
  6. read/write from P4 tables
  7. update the operational data in the internal data structures
  8. raise an event to the app
  9. etc. etc

This directory contains the top level handler to receive and deserialize the
API calls.
