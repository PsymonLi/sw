- create a system class
  - oci_state will be a member of this (rename oci_state --> cstate aka. config state)
  - oci_impl_state will be a member of this (rename oci_impl_state --> pstate aka. pipeline state)
  - move port store in to this system class (we may need a class called inventory under which
    ports, pb, register stuff etc and other physical stuff can be moved)
