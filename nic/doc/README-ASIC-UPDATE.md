README for updating capri asic pointer and asic files
=====================================================

    1) Prepare the headers and sources
        a) Add the required header files to nic/tools/asic_sw_combined_sanity/asic_headers.txt
        b) Add the required source files to nic/sdk/platform/capri/csrint/module.mk.asic_sw_combined_sanity

    2) Generate and copy diffs
        a) Generate the diff for SW repo and copy the diff as jenkins user to:
           /var/lib/jenkins/diffs/ASIC_SW_COMBINED_SANITY/sw/
        b) If corresponding ASIC changes are required, then copy the asic diff to
           /var/lib/jenkins/diffs/ASIC_SW_COMBINED_SANITY/asic

    3) Trigger the asic-sw-combined-sanity using the below link. Specify the required ASIC_BRANCH and ASSET_LABEL (ASIC SHA) in the link.
       http://srv13:8080/view/CombinedSanity/job/ASIC_SW_COMBINED_SANITY/

    4) The ASIC_SW_COMBINED_SANITY uses /var/lib/jenkins/scripts/asic_sw_combined_sanity.sh to:
        a) Pull SW repo
        b) Pull ASIC repo based on the specified SHA
        c) Apply SW patches from /var/lib/jenkins/diffs/ASIC_SW_COMBINED_SANITY/sw/
        d) Apply ASIC patches from /var/lib/jenkins/diffs/ASIC_SW_COMBINED_SANITY/asic/
        d) Copy the asic header files specified in nic/tools/asic_sw_combined_sanity/asic_headers.txt to
           nic/sdk/third-party/asic/
        e) Build the x86_64 and aarch64 asic-libs for the sources specified in
           nic/sdk/platform/capri/csrint/module.mk.asic_sw_combined_sanity
        f) copy the asic-libs to nic/sdk/third-party/asic/
        g) Build x86_64 and aarch64 NIC targets
        h) Push assets based on the ASIC SHA
        i) Increment third-party version and push it to the assets
        j) Push the changes to branch - vikasbd:asic_label_update_<ASIC_BRANCH>

    6) If any change in /var/lib/jenkins/scripts/asic_sw_combined_sanity.sh, also update in SW repo
       nic/tools/asic_sw_combined_sanity/asic_sw_combined_sanity.sh

    7) Use the below link to raise PR for the changes:
