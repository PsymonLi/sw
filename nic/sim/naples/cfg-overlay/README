1. vagrant up

   This will bringup datacenters/kingdomws (as VMs) establish VM connectivity
   between them. Additionally, each of the VMs will have NAPLES container
   running already with all the components of Pensando NIC. This container
   represents the NIC for the server in the datacenter. Use 'vagrant ssh
   node1/node2' to connect to VMs

2. Posting sample policies

   Sample postman configs are placed in the home directory of each VM. Run the
   following command in both the VMs to load the sample config

   $ newman run configs/config_vxlan_overlay/postman_collection.json -e configs/postman_env.json

3. To do a fresh re-install of the naples container, re-provision the vargant VM
   using 'vagrant halt' and 'vagrant up --provision'

Test:
There two client-server in the topology.
a) First one is in 10.30.0.0/16 subnet.
    It can be tested by:
    ping 10.30.0.64 from node1. This pings server in node2 with ip 10.30.2.15 and its vip in node1 is 10.30.0.64. 
    Client ip in node1 is 10.30.10.11
b) Second one is in 20.30.10.0/24 subnet.
    It can be tested by:
    ping 20.30.10.12. The client in node1 (20.30.10.11) pings server in node2 (20.30.10.12) over Vxlan Tunnel


By default, port 9007 of the docker container is exposed to the host (i.e., VM
representing the datacenter) and hence REST APIs can be invoked using curl.

Examples:

In this example, we will use the pre-created "default" tenant.

Use default tenant:

curl localhost:9007/api/tenants/
[{"kind":"Tenant","meta":{"name":"default","tenant":"default","namespace":"default","creation-time":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","mod-time":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"},"spec":{},"status":{"TenantID":1}}]

To use non-default tenant, do:

curl -d'{"Kind":"Tenant","meta":{"Name":"tenant-1"}}' -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:9007/api/tenants/

Create Namespaces:

curl -d'{"Kind":"Namespace","meta":{"Name":"kg1","Tenant":"default"}}' -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:9007/api/namespaces/
curl -d'{"Kind":"Namespace","meta":{"Name":"kg2","Tenant":"default"}}' -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:9007/api/namespaces/
curl -d'{"Kind":"Namespace","meta":{"Name":"public","Tenant":"default"}}' -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:9007/api/namespaces/

Please refer to the packaged json files (located in the the home directory
inside each VM) for full config for node1 and node2.

NOTE:

1. To check NAPLES container health, please do "docker ps" and look at the
   STATUS column

2. If STATUS is reported as "unhealthy", please do:

   "docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health }}"  <container-id> | jq

   This should show the reason for bad health in case container is "unhealthy"

    For example:

    [root@d34a71a8b0a2 nic]# docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS                    NAMES

    [root@d34a71a8b0a2 nic]# docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health }}"  386c47101e22 | jq

3. There is no session aging in this release as the this is CAPRI s/w model, so
   in case flow keys are reused across sessions, data path state (e.g., NAT
   bindings etc.) will be reused in the data plane as well. If this is not
   intended, NAPLES container should be restarted.
4. Currently we have 16 lifs in the container and you use all of them. One restriction today is that we do not support native packets yet.
   All packets have to be vlan tagged when coming to the NIC

5. Deletes are not fully supported on all objects.
