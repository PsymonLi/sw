# usage:
#
# freeport [from-commit] [to-commit]
#
#    from-commit - port changes after this commit, noninclusive.
#    to-commit - port changes ending with this commit.
#
# The default behavior is to port the most recent commit, as if invoked:
#
#    freeport HEAD~ HEAD
#
# After running, there may be cleanup needed for patch rejects.  Rejects will
# be written to the file platform/gen/freeport.patch.rej.
#
# It is _always_ good practice to review and test the changes after porting.
#
# example:
#
# Port the changes in the most recent commit, and then ammend it with the
# ported changes.  If the original commit had linux changes, the amended commit
# will have linux and ported freebsd changes.
#
#    # port the most recent commit
#    freeport
#
#    # check freeport.patch.rej and manually port those changes if needed
#
#    # add new and modified files under platform/drivers/freebsd/usr
#    git add usr
#
#    # amend the commit with added changes
#    git commit --amend
#
# example:
#
# Port changes in the current branch that are not upstream.
#
#    freeport @{u}
#
# example:
#
# Port the commit bd9d8e611fd6
#
#    freeport bd9d8e611fd6~ bd9d8e611fd6
#
#    # sh shorthand expands to the same as above
#    freeport bd9d8e611fd6{~,}
