This qemu patch adds a new "simbridge" device to qemu that acts as
a bridge to a simulator.  The simulator communicates over a Unix Domain
Socket (by default /tmp/simsock-$USER).

To build, first be sure to build libsimlib.so used by the simbridge device.

    make -C ../libsimlib

Then "make" in this directory.  This will download the correct version
of the qemu sources, extract, apply the patch, then build.

    make

Then run using the qemu-run script.  qemu-run sets $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to pick up libsimlib.so built in the first step.

    qemu-run
